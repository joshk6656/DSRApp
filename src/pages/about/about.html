  <p>With the DSR Method it is possible to establish a stable and controlled reef environment. Itâ€™s an all-in-one reef aquarium maintenance solution. The costs of running the DSR method are a fraction of reef salt needed for regular water changes. You learn to understand the way things work and you get more control of the biochemical processes in your reef aquarium.</p>
